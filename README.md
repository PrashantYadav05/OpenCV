# OpenCV

## How to read, write, show videos from camera:

## Drawing geometric shapes on images:

## Handle "Mouse Events":
## Matrices, Colors, & Filters:
* Manipulating matrices-creating, filling, accessing elements, and ROIs
* Converting between different data types and scaling values
* Non-image data persistence using NumPy
* Manipulating image channels
* Converting images from one color space to another
* Gamma correction and per-element math
* Mean/variance image normalization
* Computing image histograms
* Equalizing image histograms
* Removing noise using Gaussian, median, and bilateral filters
* Computing gradient images using Sobel filters
* Creating and applying your own filter
* Processing images with real-valued Gabor filters
* Going from the spatial to the frequency domain (and back) using discrete Fourier transform
* Manipulating image frequencies for image filtration
* Processing images with different thresholds 
* Morphological operators
* Binary images-image masks and binary operations

## Contours & Segmentation:
* Binarization of grayscale images using the Otsu algorithm
* Finding external and internal contours in a binaryimage
* Extracting connected components from a binary image
* Fitting lines and circles into two-dimensional point sets
* Calculating image moments
* Working with curves - approximation, length, and area
* Checking whether a point is within a contour
* Computing the distance to a two-dimensional point set from every pixel
* Image segmentation using the k-means algorithm
* Image segmentation using segment seeds, the watershed algorithm
